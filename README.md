# stock_ARIMA_forcasting
You choose a stock ticker. This app will web-scrape the data, decompose the stock's time series, and then forecast it. Forecasts are made with statistical models 'ARIMA' and 'VARMAX'. The ARIMA model first decomposes a time series into its three components 'seasonal', 'trend', and 'cycle.' Then, those components are used as building blocks to create the forecast. The VARMAX statistical forecasting model is an extended version of an ARIMA model. The VARMAX model incorporates exogenous input in an attempt to further improve the models accuracy beyond the ARIMA.
